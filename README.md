# Module 3 Challenge: SURFS UP 

Congratulations to myself! To plan for my trip to Hawaii, I am doing some climate analysis for that area to better pack. 

# Analyze and Explore the Climate Data #
In part 1 of this assignment, I am using Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and exploration of the climate database. Specifically, I am using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 

The supplied climate data files "hawaii.sqlite," "hawaii_measurements.csv," and "hawaii_stations.csv" are located in the Surfs Up/Resources folder.

My analysis considers Precipitation and Weather Stations data for the most recent entries and the most active stations. 

# Designing My Climate App #
In part 2 of this assignment, as I've already completed initial analysis, I am now designing a Flask API based on the queries that I just developed.

# In Summary #
*Used languages and packages include:* 

Anaconda - Python 

SQLAlchemy ORM queries

Pandas

Matplotlib
